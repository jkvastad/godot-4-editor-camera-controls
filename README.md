# Godot 4 Editor Style Camera
Camera controls to mimic the in editor 3D camera. Copy-paste to your heart's content!

Controls:

* Hold right mouse button to look around. This captures the mouse so it won't move outside the game window.
* Q/E for down/up
* W/S for forward/backward
* A/D for left/right

[Pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes) is capped at 90 degrees up/down. No bending over backwards.
