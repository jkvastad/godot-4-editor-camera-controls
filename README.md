# Godot 4 Editor Style Camera
Camera controls to mimic the in editor 3D camera. Copy-paste to your heart's content!

For more information on transforms and the basis (pun not intended) for the camera controls, check out the docs on [using 3D transforms](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/tutorials/3d/using_transforms.html).

Controls:

* Hold right mouse button to look around. This captures the mouse so it won't move outside the game window.
  * While holding right, use mousewheel up/down to increase/decrease movement speed.
* Q/E for down/up
* W/S for forward/backward
* A/D for left/right

[Pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes) is capped at 90 degrees up/down. No bending over backwards.
